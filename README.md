The model is built on top of VGG16, which is a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification.

* First, the VGG16 model is loaded with input_shape=(IMAGE_SIZE,IMAGE_SIZE,3), include_top=False, weights='imagenet'. The input shape is set to match the size of the images in the dataset, which is 128x128 pixels. The include_top parameter is set to False, which means that the final fully-connected layers of VGG16 that perform the classification will not be included. The weights parameter is set to 'imagenet' which means that the model will be pre-trained with a dataset of 1.4 million images called imagenet

* Next, the for layer in base_model.layers: loop is used to set all layers of the base_model (VGG16) to non-trainable, so that the weights of these layers will not be updated during training.

* Then, the last three layers of the VGG16 model are set to trainable by using base_model.layers[-2].trainable = True,base_model.layers[-3].trainable = True and base_model.layers[-4].trainable = True

* After that, a Sequential model is created and the VGG16 model is added to it with model.add(base_model).

* Next, a Flatten layer is added to the model with model.add(Flatten()) which reshapes the output of the VGG16 model from a 3D tensor to a 1D tensor, so that it can be processed by the next layers of the model.

* Then, a Dropout layer is added with model.add(Dropout(0.3)) which is used to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training time.

* After that, a dense layer is added with 128 neurons and relu activation function is added with model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu')).

* Next, another Dropout layer is added with model.add(Dropout(0.2))

* Finally, the output dense layer is added with number of neurons equal to the number of unique labels and 'softmax' activation function is added with model.add(Dense(len(unique_labels), activation='softmax')). The 'softmax' activation function is used to give a probability distribution over the possible classes.
